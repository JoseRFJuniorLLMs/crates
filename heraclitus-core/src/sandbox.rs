//! SPEC-035 — extension crash isolation (stable-ABI boundary).
//!
//! A third-party extension must never take the database down. [`run_sandboxed`]
//! wraps plugin execution in a panic boundary: a panicking or aborting
//! extension is caught and turned into an ordinary `Err`, leaving the immutable
//! log and other queries untouched.
//!
//! Honest scope: this is the in-process crash boundary (real, working). Full
//! *memory* isolation via a WebAssembly runtime (`wasmtime`/`extism`) is the
//! feature-gated upgrade — it also sits in tension with the "intelligence lives
//! in the agent, not the DB" thesis, so it stays deliberately behind a flag.
